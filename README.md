# Path-Finding
Mini-game featuring two mechanics:

- **Dynamic map construction:** The map is composed of two types of tiles â€“ passable ones, which allow the player to move freely, and blocking ones that form a unique labyrinth.

- **Intelligent movement:** The player selects a tile that is free to move, after which the system calculates the shortest path to the chosen point and directs the character along the optimal route (if such a route exists; otherwise, the character remains in place).
